<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I live in Longmont, Colorado. Being outdoors and experiencing the environment around me is at the top of my love list. But, more than anything, I live for traveling (domestically and abroad) and learning about new places and cultures! I also enjoy endurance sports and appreciate the mental and physical challenge of pushing my mind and body further than ever seems possible.</p>

<p>In the end, all my life passions inspire my design work. Enjoy reviewing part of my portfolio and reach out with any questions (morning, noon or night). I hope we can work together in the future to create compelling designs that cause consumers to act. Cheers! </p>
